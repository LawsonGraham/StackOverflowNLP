## How to post good questions on Stack Overflow?

We all know that Stack Overflow can be an extremely toxic place for new programmers. When new programmers ask questions on the platform, they get trolled and receive unhelpful answers if the community interprets the post as a 'bad' question. This discourages new coders from learning and raises the entry bar to programming.

We decided to build a Machine Learning model to classify a question as a good question to be posted or not. This model can serve as a great foundation for more advanced applications like giving recommendations to programmers to ask better questions so that they are less likely to have a bad experience and more importantly they get their questions answered without receiving unnecessary trolling and negativity.

In this project, we will be using Logistic Regression to predict whether a question asked on the well known Stack Overflow platform will receive positive or negative votes.
